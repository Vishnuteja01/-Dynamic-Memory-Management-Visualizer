# Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer

##  Description
This project implements a **Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer** using Python, Tkinter, and Matplotlib. It simulates and visualizes different memory management techniques like **Paging, Segmentation, and Virtual Memory**. The tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input their data and visualize memory allocation and page replacement processes.

##  Features
- **Paging Simulation**: Demonstrates FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms.
- **Segmentation Simulation**: Visualizes memory allocation for segments.
- **Virtual Memory Simulation**: Simulates memory allocation and page faults using a simple replacement algorithm.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays memory state changes dynamically for better understanding.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter for easy user interaction.

##  Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- matplotlib (Install via: `pip install matplotlib`)  
- tkinter (Included with Python standard library)
## Visualization
- **The program generates graphical representations of memory states using Matplotlib, with Gantt chart-like visuals for page allocation and segmentation.
