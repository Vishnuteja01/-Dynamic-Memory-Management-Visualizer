Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer
ðŸ“Œ Description
This project implements a Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer using Python, Tkinter, and Matplotlib. It simulates and visualizes different memory management techniques like Paging, Segmentation, and Virtual Memory. The tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input their data and visualize memory allocation and page replacement processes.

âœ¨ Features
Paging Simulation: Demonstrates FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms.
Segmentation Simulation: Visualizes memory allocation for segments.
Virtual Memory Simulation: Simulates memory allocation and page faults using a simple replacement algorithm.
Real-Time Visualization: Displays memory state changes dynamically for better understanding.
User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter for easy user interaction.
ðŸ”§ Requirements
Python 3.x
matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
tkinter (included with Python standard library)
ðŸ“‚ Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required packages using:
bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib
Run the program using:
bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Input your values for Pages, Frame Count, Memory Size, and Segment Sizes in the GUI.
Choose the desired simulation type (FIFO & LRU, Segmentation, Virtual Memory).
ðŸ“Š Visualization
The program generates graphical representations of memory states using Matplotlib, with Gantt chart-like visuals for page allocation and segmentation.

ðŸ“Œ Example Inputs
Pages (comma-separated): 1,2,3,4,1,2,5,1,2,3,4,5
Frame Count: 3
Memory Size (for Segmentation): 100
Segment Sizes (comma-separated): 30,20,40
